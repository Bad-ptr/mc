The *.input files for the rpm helper are what we call "tags files".
They're generated by rpm2tags.

The rpm package chosen was glib2-2.46.2-4.el7.i686.rpm (downloadable from
rpmfind.net), as it has scriptlets that demonstrate the INFO/SCRIPTS dir.

The way this test works is a bit unconventional:

We aren't overriding one or two variables in the helper but, instead,
inject a code snippet into it (see 'rpm.rewrite.sh'). This lets us
override a couple of functions to imitate the 'rpm' binary.
